# Scholar Sync Frontend

Scholar sync is used to match students in pairs according to their interests, hobbies, and other attributes.

The frontend uses Angular to provide a simple, understandable interface to access backend functionality. There are requirements for inputting csv files, a form input for submitting csv files for processing, and a results display and corresponding download. This is a bare-bones implementation/prototype and not a finished product.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.
